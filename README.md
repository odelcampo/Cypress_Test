# Cypress_Test

**First of all:**

**A detailed guide can be found in the document: "More details.pdf".**

I would like to emphasize that for the test the acceptance criteria are:

- More than 100,000 results [OK]
- Less than 10,000 results [NOK]

This detail is important because if the first acceptance criterion is met, the second will always be met.

**Technology used.**

For this technical test I decided to use Cypress and JavaScript. I have made two test cases. The code for the test cases can be found in the file "spec.cy.js" in the following path:

\technical\_Test\cypress\e2e\spec.cy.js

**Installation details.**

For the preparation of the environment and the correct execution of the tests it is recommended to follow the installation and configuration steps shown in the Cypress documentation:

**Implementation details**

After having the Cypress environment installed and configured correctly:
